## Motivation

* **Difficult to find a Silicon Valley-style startup to work at in Taiwan.**
  * Taiwan has a lot of startups that are more like SMEs. 
  * It's usually not very fun or Silicon Valley-like to work at these places.
  * A lot of well-paying startup jobs tend to be in legally gray areas, like online gambling and porn.
* **Hard to hire good engineers who want to work at startups in Taiwan.**
  * Because the quality of startups in Taiwan is not very high, most quality engineers don't want to work at startups.
  * The best engineers in Taiwan wish to work at a large enterprise, that can pay higher and offer more job security.
  * This is reversed in the US and in the valley.
* **No job seeking / hiring solution that is completely free.**
  * Currently free solutions and network can easily be not free in the future.
  * Only an open sourced solution can be truly free forever.

## Mission

* Help engineers, designers, product managers, and inspiring-entrepreneur find **quality, Silicon Valley** startups in Taiwan.
* Find hungry people who want to join a small rocket ship.
* Build out an open sourced solution that is **free forever** for startup job seeking and hiring.

* _The startup community in Taiwan owns this startup community._
